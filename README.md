# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Website Summarizer (siteSnap)

This repository contains a web application that utilizes various technologies, including React, Vite, Redux, and the Rapid API, to provide website summaries. In the process of developing this project, I gained valuable insights into the power of `useEffect` hooks and how they can efficiently manage side effects in a React application. Additionally, I deepened my understanding of Redux and how it simplifies state management in complex applications.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast and efficient build tool for web development.
- **Redux**: A state management library that streamlines data handling across components.
- **Rapid API**: A platform that provides access to various APIs, enhancing the functionality of the application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that has made styling and design a satisfying experience for me.

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, I learned:

- How to effectively use `useEffect` hooks to manage asynchronous operations and side effects in a React application.
- The benefits of Redux in maintaining a centralized state, making data flow more predictable.
- The capabilities of Rapid API in integrating external data and services into web applications seamlessly.
- The joys of working with Tailwind CSS, a CSS framework that speeds up the styling process and results in cleaner code.

I'm excited to share this project and showcase what I've learned along the way. Feel free to explore the code and try out the website summarization tool!

If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding!
